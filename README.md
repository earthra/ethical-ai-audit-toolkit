👋 Welcome
The internet is racing ahead — AI is everywhere, data fuels everything, and move fast and break things still echoes through too many boardrooms.

But what if we could move fast and build thoughtfully?

The Ethical AI Audit Toolkit helps early-stage startups and growing companies integrate AI and data practices that are:

Transparent

Human-centered

Future-proof

— without needing a 50-page compliance manual or an expensive ethics board.

🌱 About Me
I’m Esra, a data science and psychology recent grad who became obsessed with a simple idea:
Technology should make things better, not just more efficient.

My background blends behavioral science, data analytics, and tech ethics.
I’ve spent the last few years studying how people interact with technology — the good, the bad, and the deeply weird — and now I’m focused on helping startups build products that are not just smart, but trustworthy.

This toolkit is my way of making ethical AI accessible to the teams shaping the next wave of the internet.

🧩 What’s Inside

Startup Mini Audit Template —

🎯 Why I Built This
Because technology shapes culture — and right now, we’re all being shaped by AI systems few people truly understand.

Startups and growing companies have a rare opportunity: to bake in transparency, fairness, and ethical thinking early — before it's too expensive or too late.

I built this toolkit to help teams:

Move fast — but move fair.

Build user trust before it becomes a crisis.

Set a new standard for what responsible tech actually looks like.
